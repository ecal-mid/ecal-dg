            Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found). The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot). The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
            The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera). Optical work and filters are forbidden. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur). Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now). Genre movies are not acceptable. The film format must be Academy 35 mm. The director must not be credited. Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste! I am no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a work, as I regard the instant as more important than the whole. My supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings. I swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations.<br><br>

            <span>DOGMA 95 is a collection of film directors founded in Copenhagenin spring 1995. DOGMA 95 has the expressed goal of countering certain tendencies in the cinema today.<br><br>
            DOGMA 95 is a rescue action!<br><br>
            In 1960 enough was enough! The movie was dead and called for resurrection. The goal was correct but the means were not! The new wave proved to be a ripple that washed ashore and turned to muck. Slogans of individualism and freedom created works for a while, but no changes. The wave was up for grabs, like the directors themselves. The wave was never stronger than the men behind it. The anti-bourgeois cinema itself became bourgeois, because the foundations upon which its theories were based was the bourgeois perception of art. The auteur concept was bourgeois romanticism from the very start and thereby… false!<br><br>
            To DOGMA 95 cinema is not individual!<br><br>
            Today a technological storm is raging, the result of which will be the ultimate democratization of the cinema. For the first time, anyone can make movies. But the more accessible the medium becomes, the more important the avant-garde. It is no accident that the phrase avant-garde has military connotations. Discipline is the answer… we must put our films into uniform, because the individual film will be decadent by definition! DOGMA 95 counters the individual film by the principle of presenting an indisputable set of rules known as THE VOW OF CHASTITY. In 1960 enough was enough! The movie had been cosmeticized to death, they said; yet since then the use of cosmetics has exploded.
            The supreme task of the decadent film-makers is to fool the audience. Is that what we are so proud of? Is that what the 100 years have brought us? Illusions via which emotions can be communicated?… By the individual artist’s free choice of trickery? Predictability has become the golden calf around which we dance. Having the characters’ inner lives justify the plot is too complicated, and not high art. As never before, the superficial action and the superficial movie are receiving all the praise.The result is barren. An illusion of pathos and an illusion of love.<br><br>
            To DOGMA 95 the movie is not illusion!<br><br>
            Today a technological storm is raging of which the result is the elevation of cosmetics to God. By using new technology anyone at any time can wash the last grains of truth away in the deadly embrace of sensation. The illusions are everything the movie can hide behind. DOGMA 95 counters the film of illusion by the presentation of an indisputable set of rules know as THE VOW OF CHASTITY.

            The most radical film-making movement since the French new wave is finished. But it continues to inspire the biggest names in world cinema. Ryan Gilbey travels to Copenhagen to ask its founders why they did it and what it means. In the grounds of Film City, the converted army barracks in the Copenhagen suburb of Hvidovre, the bleak monotony of the landscape is disturbed by some sweetly eccentric touches. A quartet of garden gnomes has congregated in one corner of the lawn to pee, while beyond the offices of Zentropa and Nimbus, the film companies who finance most of Denmark’s cinematic output, you will find a magnificent tank belonging to Lars von Trier. He tells me that he received it as a Christmas present, as though such a gift were as commonplace as bath salts. And there it rests, imposing but ultimately useless, like a plaything discarded by a bored, fickle god.<br>
            The pressing question is whether Dogme95, the Vow of Chastity drawn up by Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, has suffered the same fate. If you arrive at Film City expecting to find the place bristling with the rebellious spirit of Dogme95, you are likely to feel disheartened. It isn’t the premises themselves, which suggest well-organised hippie communes: in the Nimbus office, someone’s dog scampers among the desks, and, over at Zentropa, employees are encouraged to wear their slippers to work. But it’s hard to ignore the fact that traces of Dogme are not much in evidence these days.

            Dogme 95 was a film and video movement that energized Danish film production
            and provoked reams of publicity and criticism. The conceit of the movement was to
            rail against aesthetic considerations and to make films in a uniform fashion; to move
            beyond tired formalism and find freedom within a rigid set of self-imposed rules.

As courage and moral fibre weaken and relationships grow shaky, Henry, a theatrical manager, persuades the group to put on Shakespeare’s tragedy King Lear.

With a large house as their base, they spend all their spare time together exploring the hidden and less appreciated values of idiocy. They practise!

Nothing can be compared to the mutual feeling of success, every time their personal limits are transcended in yet another scenario. By accident Karen meets 3 members of the group and unintentionally she gets involved in their little game.

      <p>The film takes place decades after the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom for the control of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean.
        The film tells of Fabián Stratas, a magician and stand-up comedian from Buenos Aires, who saves his money from weddings, birthdays, and bar mitzvahs, and uses a hidden camera to document a week-long trip to the Falkland Islands, (or Fuckland, as he calls them), where he has an ingenious Argentine patriotic plan: to impregnate a Falklander woman.
        Stratas has a theory: if only 500 Argentines did the same each year, the islands would soon be overrun with half-Argentines, and he would be the head of a "sexual invasion."
