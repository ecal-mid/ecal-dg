         If we want to talk about surveillance, we need to look at the history of our contemporary society. What are the factors that made our governments paranoid enough to watch our every move? Starting from the times of the inquisition to the current day, <span class="italic">Seeing everything</span> proposes a timeline of various authors who analysed and wrote about their own time.

         From Francesco Peña, a writer who described the purge by the Catholic church between 1200 and 1500, to the contemporary artwork of Metahaven and Trevor Paglen, artists that discuss the relationship between the “Mass data collect” and modern capitalism, this project is a collection of texts and images by different authors. These writings talk about the approaches and ideas of these people with a contemporary point of view.
